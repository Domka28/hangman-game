The Hangman game involves randomly selecting a word and allows the player to guess the chosen word. 
I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the application. 
The app includes a feature that reveals the word if the player fails to guess it, 
and it also allows for the selection of another random word. 
It displays the category of the current word and indicates how many words are in the database.

The application was developed for learning purposes and to deepen knowledge of JavaScript.
